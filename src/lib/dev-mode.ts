/**
 * Central policy for "should this paid/external service be mocked?"
 *
 * Every integration in SaCMS that depends on a paid third-party service
 * (Midtrans, Vercel, v0.dev, Cloudflare R2) should gate its mock
 * fallback through `shouldUseMockServices()` / `isMockAllowed()` rather than
 * inventing its own ad-hoc check. Before this module existed, each client
 * decided independently whether to simulate — several (Vercel,
 * v0.dev) only checked "is the API key missing?" with no regard for
 * NODE_ENV, which meant a misconfigured production deployment (env var
 * typo'd or simply forgotten) would silently start fabricating successful
 * deployments/VPS provisions instead of failing loudly. Others (Midtrans,
 * R2) had no fallback at all, so the full payment/storage test matrix
 * could never run without real, billable credentials.
 *
 * The rule enforced here:
 *   - In `production`, mocking is NEVER allowed, even if a credential is
 *     missing — the real call is attempted and its real error surfaces.
 *     A production deployment must fail loudly on a missing key, not
 *     quietly pretend to succeed.
 *   - In every other NODE_ENV (`development`, `test`, or unset), mocking
 *     is allowed whenever the real credential for that specific service
 *     is absent — so local development and the automated test suite never
 *     require a live, paid subscription to exercise these flows end to
 *     end, but a developer who DOES set real sandbox/test credentials
 *     locally still exercises the real integration.
